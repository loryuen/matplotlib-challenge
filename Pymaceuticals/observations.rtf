\
1. Tumors volume (mm3) decreased with treatments of Capomulin and Ramicane. Capomulin treatments resulted in a 19% decrease in tumor size over a 45 day treatment, and 22% for Ramicane. All other treatments failed as a result of increased tumor size from a range of 42% to 57%.\
\
2. The number of metastatic sites increased for all treatments, but at a lower rate for Capomulin and Ramicane. After a 45 day treatment, there were an average of around 1.5 and 1.3 new metastatic sites for Capomulin and Ramicane, respectively, compared to a range of 1.7 to 3.4 new metastatic sites for other treatments.\
\
3. Survival rate of mice was highest for Capomulin (84%) and Ramicane (80%) by day 45 of treatment. In comparison, other treatments had a survival rate ranging from 27% to 56%.}
